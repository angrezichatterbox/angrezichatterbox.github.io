<p>Hugo, in case you&rsquo;re wondering, is an absolute gem when it comes to crafting websites effortlessly. It&rsquo;s an open-source static site generator that works like pure magic, transforming your ideas into captivating web pages with minimal fuss. 🪄 You can think of Hugo as the ultimate wand for web creation.</p>
<p>Hugo itself is a static site generator built with Go (also known as Golang). It gracefully takes content files and templates to orchestrate the birth of a complete website.</p>
<h3 id="the-website-is-created-for-task-2-of-amfoss-praveshan-2023">The website is created for Task 2 of amFOSS Praveshan 2023.<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-website-is-created-for-task-2-of-amfoss-praveshan-2023">#</a></h3>
<p>Now, allow me to narrate the enthralling journey of piecing together this webpage:</p>
<p>I started by reading about the task list that was given to me. I read about Hugo and how it&rsquo;s an easy way to create static web pages without much coding of any sort (even though later on, I had to use Visual Studio to make my tasks easier). I first went to the terminal on my Mac. Since Brew was already installed for a previous task, I didn&rsquo;t need to install it again.</p>
<p>Then I created a folder on my Desktop to store the files of the website.</p>
<p>Next, I went to the terminal to install Hugo, for which I used the statement:</p>
<h4 id="brew-install-hugo">brew install hugo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#brew-install-hugo">#</a></h4>
<p>After that, I created the site UIs. I found a theme that suited my style and installed it into the same directory using the command:</p>
<h4 id="git-clone-httpsgithubcomadityatelangehugo-papermod-themespapermod---depth1">git clone <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod">https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod</a> themes/PaperMod &ndash;depth=1<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#git-clone-httpsgithubcomadityatelangehugo-papermod-themespapermod---depth1">#</a></h4>
<p>Upon checking, I found that a folder I created on the desktop had Hugo files in it. I explored different files within it.</p>
<p>After installing all the dependencies required by Hugo, I started building the site with the following commands:</p>
<p>I created the webpage using the command:</p>
<h4 id="hugo-new-site-hugo-demo">hugo new site hugo-demo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hugo-new-site-hugo-demo">#</a></h4>
<p>To run the website, I used the command:</p>
<h4 id="hugo-server">hugo server<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hugo-server">#</a></h4>
<p>This created a local host within my computer. I then opened up the Safari browser and typed localhost:1313, which opened the website.</p>
<p>Following that, I added my first content to the website</p>
<p>For adding content to the website i opened the folder containing the website in visual studio code . Then within the contents folder added a folder names blogs within which i created my first blog that is
second.md
